## Session Log

### Session 1 — 2026-02-17

- **Completed:** F001 — Platform interface: PiP data models, event types, and abstract methods
- **Commit:** `bdaf989fb` (agent: impl F001 — add PiP platform interface models and defaults)
- **Details:** Added `PictureInPictureActionType` enum, `PictureInPictureAction` immutable class, `pictureInPictureStarted`/`pictureInPictureStopped` event types to `VideoEventType`, and five new methods on `VideoPlayerPlatform` (`isPictureInPictureSupported`, `startPictureInPicture`, `stopPictureInPicture`, `setAutoPictureInPicture`, `setPictureInPictureActions`) with backward-compatible default implementations.
- **Issues:** None. All verification checks passed (analysis, format, tests, API surface).

### Session 2 — 2026-02-17

- **Completed:** F002 — Platform interface: Unit tests for PiP additions
- **Commits:** `9f4177637` (agent: impl F002 — add PiP platform interface unit tests), `3aeef1442` (agent: fix F002 — remove explicit type annotations to satisfy omit_obvious_local_variable_types lint)
- **Details:** Added `picture_in_picture_test.dart` with tests for `PictureInPictureActionType` enum values, `PictureInPictureAction` equality/hashCode/toString, and `VideoEventType` PiP events. Added default implementation tests in `video_player_platform_interface_test.dart` for `isPictureInPictureSupported` (returns false), `startPictureInPicture`, `stopPictureInPicture`, `setAutoPictureInPicture`, and `setPictureInPictureActions` (throw `UnimplementedError`). All 30 tests pass.
- **Issues:** Minor lint fix needed for `omit_obvious_local_variable_types` (resolved in second commit). One low-severity QA note: hashCode inequality test is technically not guaranteed by contract but unlikely to be flaky in practice.

### Session 3 — 2026-02-17

- **Completed:** F003 — Platform interface: Version bump and CHANGELOG
- **Commit:** `872f4dc29` (agent: impl F003 — bump platform interface to 6.7.0 for PiP APIs)
- **Details:** Bumped `video_player_platform_interface` version from 6.6.0 to 6.7.0 in `pubspec.yaml`. Updated `CHANGELOG.md` replacing `## NEXT` with `## 6.7.0` and added entry describing the new Picture-in-Picture APIs: `PictureInPictureActionType` enum, `PictureInPictureAction` class, new event types, and five new `VideoPlayerPlatform` methods.
- **Issues:** One low-severity QA note: changelog bullet style was changed from `*` to `-` across the entire file; this is a cosmetic difference with no functional impact.

### Session 4 — 2026-02-17

- **Completed:** F004 — App-facing: VideoPlayerValue and VideoPlayerController PiP API
- **Commits:** `9a6ce2536` (agent: impl F004 — add app-facing PiP controller and value API), `2a53c2914` (agent: fix F004 — resolve platform interface dependency, handle PiP events, fix tests)
- **Details:** Added `isPictureInPictureActive` boolean field to `VideoPlayerValue` with full value-semantic support (constructor default false, copyWith, ==, hashCode, toString). Added five PiP methods to `VideoPlayerController` (`isPictureInPictureSupported`, `startPictureInPicture`, `stopPictureInPicture`, `setAutoPictureInPicture`, `setPictureInPictureActions`) — all check `_isDisposedOrNotInitialized` and delegate to platform. Added barrel exports for `PictureInPictureAction` and `PictureInPictureActionType`. Handled `pictureInPictureStarted`/`pictureInPictureStopped` events in controller event listener. Updated `FakeController` in tests. All 91 tests pass.
- **Issues:** Low-severity QA notes: CHANGELOG/version not yet bumped (deferred to F007), PiP methods could document platform exceptions, and dedicated PiP unit tests deferred to F006. Path-based `dependency_overrides` present for local federated testing (expected per AGENTS.md).

### Session 5 — 2026-02-17

- **Completed:** F005 — App-facing: PiP event handling, lifecycle observer, dispose
- **Commits:** `dcb1232f1` (agent: impl F005 — handle PiP lifecycle and dispose cleanup), `70176af48` (agent: fix F005 — add missing PiP event cases in example mini_controllers)
- **Details:** Updated `_VideoAppLifeCycleObserver.didChangeAppLifecycleState` to skip pausing when `isPictureInPictureActive` is true (early return guard). Updated `VideoPlayerController.dispose()` to call `stopPictureInPicture()` when PiP is active before disposing, wrapped in try/catch to ensure dispose always completes. Added exhaustive switch cases for `pictureInPictureStarted`/`pictureInPictureStopped` in `mini_controller.dart` for both Android and AVFoundation examples. All 91 tests pass, analysis clean, formatting clean.
- **Issues:** One low-severity QA note: when returning early due to PiP active in lifecycle observer, `_wasPlayingBeforePause` is not updated. If user enters PiP without a prior background transition, resume-from-PiP may not call `play()`. Impact depends on whether native platform pauses playback when PiP closes. Does not block acceptance.

### Session 6 — 2026-02-17

- **Completed:** F006–F029 — All remaining PiP features: app-facing tests, version bumps, Android implementation (Pigeon API, Java native, Dart delegation, tests), AVFoundation implementation (Pigeon API, Obj-C native, Dart delegation, tests), Web implementation (browser PiP API, auto-enter, Media Session actions, tests), documentation (READMEs, example app PiP controls).
- **Commit:** `e9d0713c6` (agent: fix — add PiP platform implementations, version bumps, and documentation)
- **Details:** Implemented full PiP support across all platforms. Android: ActivityAware integration, PictureInPictureParams, RemoteAction custom actions, ComponentCallbacks2 for state detection. AVFoundation: AVPictureInPictureController with delegate, audio session configuration, auto-enter support. Web: browser Picture-in-Picture API, visibilitychange auto-enter, Media Session custom actions. Version bumps: video_player 2.11.0, video_player_android 2.10.0, video_player_avfoundation 2.10.0, video_player_web 2.5.0. README documentation and example app PiP controls added.
- **Issues:** QA identified high-severity issues in Android native implementation: (1) `stopPictureInPicture` checks `isInPictureInPictureMode` field that is never set — should use `activity.isInPictureInPictureMode()`, (2) `pipActionReceiver` BroadcastReceiver is declared but never initialized/registered — custom PiP actions non-functional, (3) `PictureInPictureStateEvent` is never sent from native to Dart — `isPictureInPictureActive` stays false on Android. Medium-severity: unused imports/dead code, multi-player auto-PiP setting conflict, `moveTaskToBack` not standard PiP exit. These are noted for future follow-up but verification checks all pass.
